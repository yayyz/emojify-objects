# emojify-objects

This is a class project from CS 534 class, Computational Photograpy class.
The code is in MATLAB and was written with one other person. 
The following files are NOT implemented by us: 
	-bfilter2.m
	-cartoon.m
	-colorspace.m
	-bilateral.m
	-localized_seg.m
	-some parts in segmentation.m 

The goal of the project is to detect an object in an image  and to create an emoji. Detecting an object in an image was a challenge for us when we work on this project. To get a better result, user selects a rough boundary of the image. 

Right now it is more similar to sticker than emoji since emoji is not an image.
Some improvement of this project can be made with: 
 	-create a better user interface (right now it only runs in MATLAB)
	-if going for sticker approach, minimize low resolution problem when resizingan image
	-if going for emoji, how to convert from photo to text format?
